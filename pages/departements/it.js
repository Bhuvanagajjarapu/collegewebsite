          <h1>WELCOME TO <mark>IT</mark> DEPARTMENT</h1>
          <h1>Information Technology (IT)</h1>
          <p>The Department of Information Technology was established in the academic year 2001-02 with an annual intake of 60.  The intake is increased to 180 from the academic year 2020-21.</p>
          <p>The programme is duly approved by the AICTE and the Government of Andhra Pradesh and is affiliated to JNTUK, Kakinada. The B.Tech. Programme in Information Technology is accredited by NBA (National Board of Accreditation, AICTE, Delhi) under Tier-I in June 2019.</p>
          <p>The Department has a number of well-equipped laboratories and provides excellent facilities for learning. All Computer Labs and Servers are supported by robust and reliable UPS system with 30 min. backup. Besides the labs are also supported by a 420KVA generator.</p>
          <p>The Department periodically organizes seminars, symposia, workshops and guest lectures for the benefit of both the students and the faculty. Personality Development programs are regularly conducted for the benefit of the students. These programmes help in imparting and developing soft skills which help the students to enhance the commitment at all levels.</p>
